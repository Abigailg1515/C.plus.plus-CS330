## History
Name: C++ Scripting Language

C++ was created by the Danish developer Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 but wasn't released to the public until 1983. Stroustrup created the language at AT&T Bell Laboratories as an extension of the C language. His goal was to create an efficient and flexible language that could provide stronger features for program organization. 

C++ is an object-oriented programming language and is mainly used in creating large-scale operations. Mainly, compilers, cloud storage, databases, game dev, and graphic designs.

I plan to learn C++ through the usage of video platforms (YouTube), books, and public websites with the guidance of the computer science faculty at Simmons University.

## Getting Started

Install: I started the installation process with a recommended YouTube video from my peer that was vetted by my professor. My installation of C++ took place entirely in VS Code (Coding Platform) through C++ extension packs. 

Visual Studio Code is a widely used integrated development environment (IDE) for developing C++ code, so I will be learning C++ in VS code because this is the only IDE I have programmed and is suitable for learning C++.

Running C++: You need a compiler and a C++ program file with a .cpp extension. First, you need to open a terminal window and ensure that the correct file path is mentioned. Make sure you save your file and then you can run your program. An example of a basic "Hello World" program will be listed below. 

Commenting: A single-line comment is down through a double slash (//) and a multi-line comment is done through a slash and asterisk before and after the comment (/* comment */). 

Hello World Code Below:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World";
}
```
